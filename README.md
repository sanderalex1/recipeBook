I want to use this website as a reference https://www.matprat.no/hva-har-du-i-kjoleskapet?included=1203 using TheMealDB API. On the left I'll do categories with search bar on the top. I'll have to make such categories as Breakfest, Starter, Meat, Seafood, Pasta, Side, Vegan, Vegeterian, Dessert and Miscellaneous. Recommended to keep the order.

As a main stack I'll use JS and React with MUI.

I want to make a MUI pallet with reusable component to build a webpage as a lego. For this goal I need to learn MUI customization with creating custom components and pallet.
